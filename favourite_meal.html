    <h2>My Favourite Meal is Rice and Beans.</h2>
    <p>Rice and Beans is one of my favourite Meal. It has a way of making me feel healthy because it combines both carbohydrates and proteins in one meal, alongside other vitamins and minerals used in preparing the sauce or stew used in taking this delicacy. </p>
    <p>Rice and beans is a staple food in many cultures, and in Nigeria, it is a favorite for kids and adults; this classic meal is not complete without stews and sauces like Ata din-din, Chicken stew, fish stew, or beef stew. </p>
